# ShaderGraph_LightNodes
Custom Unity Shader Graph nodes for retrieval of light information as well as Lambert and Specular Blinn-Phong with support for additional lights.
Tested on ShaderGraph 4.1.0-preview and Lightweight RP 4.0.1-preview, Unity 2018.3b6. Let me know about any problems with newer versions.
